# Stable and Stabilized Hybrid Finite Element Methods for Miscible Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media

This repository contains the code developed for the research titled "Stable and Stabilized Hybrid Finite Element Methods for Miscible Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media", which was conducted as a requirement to obtain a master's degree in computational modeling.

The main objective of this study is to investigate hybrid methods that utilize stable and stabilized finite elements for modeling incompressible miscible displacements in porous media using both transport and Darcy's equations. 

The code included in this repository serves as a tool for implementing and testing the proposed methods, and can be used by researchers interested in further exploring this area of study.
