# Stable and Stabilized Hybrid Finite Element Methods for Miscible Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media

This repository hosts the code from the research "Stable and Stabilized Hybrid Finite Element Methods for Miscible Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media", a requisite for a master's degree in computational modeling. The research focuses on hybrid finite element methods, emphasizing stability and stabilization for simulating incompressible miscible displacements in porous media. It integrates transport and Darcy's equations. The provided code facilitates implementation and evaluation of these methods, aiding researchers in advancing this field of study.
